<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

<p>Lets face it, times are hard and IT security is a pain in the ass. Your data probably won't be kept safe, infact, I do intend to sell your usernames and passwords to a guy in Uganda for many many dollars. Plaese, include your passport number, credit card number and anything else that you think might be valuable. A warning to anybody though, who thinks it is clever to include profanity in their team name or even attempts to hurt my beatiful website by including funky characters that do nasty things. </p>
